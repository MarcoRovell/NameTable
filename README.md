# NameTable
An accurate NameTable used by programming languages to keep track of scopes and identifiers
Some important information about the project:
  - Utilized the most time efficient algorithms and structures (incorporated hash maps, linked lists, and vectors)
  - Capable of reading through 200,000 lines of code in ~12 milliseconds
  - Correctly labels an identifiers scope as well as removing them once the identifierâ€™s scope ends
  
 This NameTable project was created for Spring '22 CS32 taught by David Smallberg.
